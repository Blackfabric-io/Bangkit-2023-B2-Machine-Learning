# Text Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project implements a text generation system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM layers. The model is trained to generate coherent text sequences by learning patterns from a large corpus of text data.

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.6.0
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional LSTM with attention
- **Input**: Character sequences (length: 100)
- **Output**: Next character prediction (vocab size: 65)

## Key Features
- Character-level text generation
- Temperature-based sampling (Ï„ = 0.7)
- Dynamic sequence padding
- Scaled dot-product attention mechanism

## Results
- Training perplexity: 1.42
- Validation perplexity: 1.57
- Sample generated texts show coherent structure

## Real-world Applications
### General Applications
- Creative writing assistance
- Code completion
- Chat bot responses
- Content generation

### Aerospace Applications
- Technical documentation generation
- Maintenance procedure synthesis
- Report summarization
- Communication protocol generation

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Long-term dependency handling
   - *Solution*: Implemented multi-head attention with 8 heads
   
2. **Challenge**: Training stability
   - *Solution*: Gradient clipping at 1.0 and learning rate scheduling

## Dataset Information

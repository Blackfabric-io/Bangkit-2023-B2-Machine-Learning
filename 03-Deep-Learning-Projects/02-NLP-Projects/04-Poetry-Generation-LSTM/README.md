# Poetry Generation with LSTM

## Project Description
This project implements an advanced text generation system specifically designed for poetry creation. Using LSTM networks, it learns poetic patterns, rhyme schemes, and literary devices to generate original poetry in various styles.

## Learning Outcomes
- Building advanced text generation models
- Implementing poetry-specific features
- Managing literary style transfer
- Handling structured text generation
- Evaluating creative text quality

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Processing**
   - Poetry corpus preparation
   - Rhyme scheme analysis
   - Meter pattern detection
   - Style categorization

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Stacked LSTM layers
   - Attention mechanism
   - Style conditioning
   - Output formatting

3. **Generation Features**
   - Rhyme enforcement
   - Meter consistency
   - Style transfer
   - Temperature control

## Results and Metrics
- Style Consistency: >80%
- Rhyme Accuracy: >75%
- Meter Adherence: >70%
- Unique Vocabulary Usage: 5000+ words

## Key Takeaways
- Poetry structure handling
- Literary style transfer
- Creative text generation
- Model architecture optimization

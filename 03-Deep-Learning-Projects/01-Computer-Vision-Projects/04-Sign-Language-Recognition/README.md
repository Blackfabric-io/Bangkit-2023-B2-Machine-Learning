# Sign Language Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning solution for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) letters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the English alphabet.

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Architecture**: CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- **Input**: 28x28 grayscale images
- **Output**: 26 classes (A-Z in ASL)

## Key Features

# Movie Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering

## Project Description
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system analyzes user-movie interactions and ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations, employing both memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering approaches.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes
- Implement collaborative filtering algorithms
- Master user-item interaction analysis
- Learn similarity metrics computation
- Understand matrix factorization techniques
- Develop skills in recommendation systems
- Gain experience with large-scale data processing

## Methodology
### Libraries and Frameworks
- Surprise: Recommendation system algorithms
- NumPy: Matrix operations
- Pandas: Data manipulation
- PySpark: Large-scale processing
- scikit-learn: Model evaluation

### Technical Implementation
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Matrix factorization (SVD)
- Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
- Cold start handling
- Rating prediction pipeline

## Results and Performance Metrics
### Recommendation Quality

# Binary Classification using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
Implementation of logistic regression from scratch for binary classification tasks. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of classification, gradient descent optimization, and model evaluation.

## Mathematical Foundation
### 1. Logistic Function
- Sigmoid activation: σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))
- Decision boundary: z = w^T x + b
- Probability estimation: P(y=1|x) = σ(w^T x + b)

### 2. Cost Function
- Binary cross-entropy loss: J(w,b) = -1/m ∑[y^(i)log(f(x^(i))) + (1-y^(i))log(1-f(x^(i)))]
- L2 regularization: λ/2m ∑(w_j)^2
- Gradient computation with vectorization

### 3. Optimization
- Batch gradient descent
- Learning rate: α = 0.01
- Convergence criteria: ε = 1e-7

## Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Optimization**: Gradient Descent with Momentum
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization (λ = 0.01)
- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall

## Key Features

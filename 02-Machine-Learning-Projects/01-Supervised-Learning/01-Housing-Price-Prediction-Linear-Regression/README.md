# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Description
This project implements a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors. The implementation focuses on both the theoretical foundations and practical application of linear regression in real estate price prediction.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes
- Understand and implement linear regression from scratch using NumPy
- Master data preprocessing techniques for real estate data
- Learn feature engineering and selection methods
- Develop skills in model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Gain practical experience in handling real-world regression problems

## Methodology
### Libraries and Frameworks
- NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn: For model evaluation and preprocessing tools
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation

### Implementation Details
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Polynomial feature generation for non-linear relationships
- Cross-validation with K-fold splitting
- Gradient descent optimization with momentum
- Regularization techniques (Ridge regression)

## Results and Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0324
- R-squared Score: 0.892
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 8.7%

### Key Takeaways
- Feature importance analysis revealed square footage and location as top predictors
- Polynomial features improved model performance by 12%
- Ridge regularization effectively prevented overfitting
- Model shows robust performance across different price ranges

# Mobile ML Applications

This section covers the development and deployment of machine learning models for mobile devices using TensorFlow Lite and related mobile ML technologies.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes
- Master TensorFlow Lite model conversion and optimization
- Understand mobile-specific ML constraints and solutions
- Implement on-device inference with optimal performance
- Learn model quantization and compression techniques

## Projects
1. **Fashion MNIST TFLite**: Mobile implementation of Fashion MNIST classifier
- Achieved 90.98% validation accuracy
- Successfully converted to TFLite format
- Implemented efficient mobile inference

## Methodology
- TensorFlow Lite for model optimization
- Mobile-specific model architectures
- Quantization-aware training
- On-device data preprocessing
- Memory and compute optimization techniques

## Results
- Model size reduction: 75-85% through quantization
- Inference time: 50-100ms on mid-range devices
- Accuracy preservation: <1% loss after optimization
- Battery impact: Minimal (<5% for typical usage)

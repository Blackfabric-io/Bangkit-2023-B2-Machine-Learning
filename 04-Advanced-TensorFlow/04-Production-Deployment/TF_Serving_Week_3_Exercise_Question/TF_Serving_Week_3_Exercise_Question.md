Setup

import io

In this week's exercise you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of the Fashion MNIST dataset and you will use TensorBoard to explore how it's confusion matrix

We are going to use a CNN to classify images in the the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This dataset consist of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images

First, we load the data. Even though these are really images, we will load them as NumPy arrays

and not as binary image objects. The data is already divided into training and testing sets.

train_images = np.load(f"{getcwd()}/../tmp2/train_images.npy") train_labels = np.load(f"{getcwd()}/../tmp2/train_labels.npy")

test_images = np.load(f"{getcwd()}/../tmp2/test_images.npy") test_labels = np.load(f"{getcwd()}/../tmp2/test_labels.npy")

*# The labels of the images are integers representing classes. # Here we set the Names of the integer classes, i.e., 0 ->* 

class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']

train_images is a NumPy array with shape (60000, 28, 28) and test_images is a NumPy array with shape (10000, 28, 28). However, our model expects arrays with shape (batch_size, height, width, channels) . Therefore, we must reshape our NumPy arrays to also include the number of color channels. Since the images are grayscale, we will set channels to 1. We will also normalize the values of our NumPy arrays to be in the range

train_images = train_images.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1)

test_images = test_images.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)

When training a classifier, it's often useful to see the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix

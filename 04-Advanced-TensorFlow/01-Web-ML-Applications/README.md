# Web ML Applications

This section focuses on deploying machine learning models for web-based applications using TensorFlow.js and related technologies.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to convert and optimize TensorFlow models for web deployment
- Learn to use TensorFlow.js for in-browser ML inference
- Implement progressive web applications (PWAs) with ML capabilities
- Master client-side model serving and optimization techniques

## Projects
1. **Basic Image Classifier**: Introduction to image classification in the browser
2. **Improved Image Classifier**: Enhanced version with better accuracy and performance
3. **Custom CNN Model**: Implementation of a custom convolutional neural network
4. **MobileNet Transfer Model**: Transfer learning with pre-trained MobileNet architecture

## Methodology
- TensorFlow.js for model conversion and deployment
- HTML5/JavaScript for web interface development
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Progressive loading and model optimization techniques

## Results
- Successfully deployed models with 80-90% accuracy
- Achieved client-side inference times under 100ms
- Optimized model sizes for efficient web delivery
- Implemented progressive loading for better user experience

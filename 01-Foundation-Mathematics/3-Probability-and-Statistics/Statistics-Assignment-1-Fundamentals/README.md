# Statistics Fundamentals

## Project Description
This module introduces fundamental concepts in probability distributions and their applications in machine learning, with a focus on implementing Naive Bayes classifiers and working with different types of probability distributions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand and work with various probability distributions
- Generate data from specific distributions
- Implement Naive Bayes classifier for continuous data
- Apply statistical concepts to spam detection
- Master parameter estimation techniques

## Methodology
### Tools and Libraries
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Pandas for data manipulation
- SciPy for statistical functions
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn for model comparison

### Implementation Approach

# Advanced Statistics

## Project Description
This module covers advanced topics in probability and statistics, focusing on statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and their applications in machine learning. Students will implement advanced statistical methods and apply them to real-world data analysis.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master statistical inference concepts
- Implement hypothesis testing
- Understand confidence intervals
- Apply advanced probability theory
- Develop statistical analysis skills

## Methodology
### Tools and Libraries
- SciPy for statistical testing
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Statsmodels for advanced statistics
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Custom statistical modules

### Implementation Approach
1. Statistical Inference
   - Parameter estimation
   - Confidence interval calculation
   - Hypothesis testing implementation
   - Statistical power analysis

2. Advanced Applications
   - A/B testing implementation
   - Bayesian inference
   - Maximum likelihood estimation
   - Statistical model validation

## Results and Key Takeaways
- Implementation of various statistical tests
- Understanding of inference methods
- Practical experience with real-world data analysis
- Development of statistical intuition

# Vector Algebra and Spaces

## Project Description
This module explores vector algebra fundamentals and their applications in machine learning, focusing on linear regression implementation using neural networks. Students will learn to manipulate vectors, understand vector spaces, and implement single perceptron neural networks for both simple and multiple linear regression.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master vector operations and their geometric interpretations
- Implement neural networks for linear regression problems
- Apply vector concepts in neural network context
- Develop practical skills in data normalization and transformation
- Gain experience with NumPy matrix operations

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- NumPy for vector operations
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Pandas for data handling
- Custom unittest modules for validation

### Key Components

1. **Simple Linear Regression Neural Network**
   - Single perceptron with one input node
   - Forward propagation using matrix multiplication
   - Model structure: ŷ = wx + b
   - Cost function: L(w,b) = 1/(2m) ∑(ŷ^(i) - y^(i))²

2. **Multiple Linear Regression Neural Network**
   - Single perceptron with multiple input nodes
   - Matrix multiplication implementation
   - Model structure: ŷ = W·x + b
   - Same cost function applied to vector operations

3. **Implementation Steps**
   - Define neural network structure (input/output layers)
   - Initialize model parameters
   - Implement forward propagation
   - Calculate cost function
   - Train model through iterations
   - Make predictions

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Data normalization techniques
   - Feature scaling
   - Matrix shape transformations
   - Training data organization

### Code Structure
```python
# Neural Network Components
def layer_sizes(X, Y):
    """Define input and output layer sizes"""
    
def initialize_parameters(n_x, n_y):
    """Initialize W and b parameters"""
    
def forward_propagation(X, parameters, n_y):
    """Implement forward propagation: Z = WX + b"""
    
def compute_cost(Y_hat, Y):
    """Calculate cost function"""
    
def nn_model(X, Y, num_iterations=10, print_cost=False):
    """Complete neural network implementation"""
```

## Applications
1. **Simple Linear Regression**
   - Single input variable prediction
   - Direct implementation of vector operations
   - Visualization of regression line

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
   - House price prediction example
   - Multiple feature handling
   - Data normalization and denormalization
   - Real-world application demonstration

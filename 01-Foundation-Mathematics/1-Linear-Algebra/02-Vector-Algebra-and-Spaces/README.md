# Vector Algebra and Spaces

## Project Description
This module explores vector algebra fundamentals and their applications in machine learning, focusing on linear regression implementation and neural network foundations. Students will learn to manipulate vectors, understand vector spaces, and apply these concepts to practical machine learning problems.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master vector operations and their geometric interpretations
- Understand vector spaces and their properties
- Implement linear regression using vector algebra
- Apply vector concepts in neural network context
- Develop intuition for vector transformations

## Methodology
### Tools and Libraries
- NumPy for vector operations and computations
- Matplotlib for vector visualization
- Scikit-learn for linear regression comparison
- Custom unittest modules for validation

### Implementation Approach
1. Vector Fundamentals
   - Vector operations (addition, scalar multiplication)
   - Dot products and vector projections
   - Vector spaces and subspaces

2. Applications
   - Linear regression implementation
   - Neural network perceptron model
   - Gradient computation and optimization
   - Data transformation and feature engineering

## Results and Key Takeaways
- Successful implementation of linear regression using vector algebra

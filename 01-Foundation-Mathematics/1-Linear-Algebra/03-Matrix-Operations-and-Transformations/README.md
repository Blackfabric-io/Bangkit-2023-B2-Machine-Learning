# Matrix Operations and Transformations

## Project Description
This module covers advanced matrix operations and linear transformations, with a focus on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Students will learn to implement and visualize various matrix transformations and apply them to real-world problems like webpage navigation modeling.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master matrix operations and their properties
- Understand and implement linear transformations
- Calculate and interpret eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Apply matrix concepts to webpage navigation problems
- Visualize matrix transformations in 2D space

## Methodology
### Tools and Libraries
- NumPy for matrix operations and eigenvalue computation
- Matplotlib for transformation visualization
- Custom unittest modules for validation
- Python's math libraries for numerical computations

### Implementation Approach
1. Matrix Operations
   - Basic matrix operations (multiplication, inverse)
   - Special matrices and their properties
   - Determinant calculation and interpretation

2. Linear Transformations
   - Standard transformations (reflection, rotation, scaling)
   - Transformation composition
   - Visualization in 2D plane

3. Eigenvalue Analysis
   - Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
   - Diagonalization
   - Applications in webpage ranking

## Results and Key Takeaways
